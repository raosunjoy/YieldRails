# **YieldRails – The Yield-Powered Stablecoin Payment Rail**
*Seamless payments with built-in yields. Bridging DeFi and global commerce.*

---

## **🚀 Investment Thesis**

### **The Problem**
- **$4.1T monthly** stablecoin volume but **0% yields** to users (Circle/Tether pocket $12B+ annually in T-bill profits)
- **Cross-border pain**: SWIFT costs 5-7%, takes 2-5 days; cards charge 2-3% fees
- **$685B remittance market** underserved by traditional rails

### **The Solution**
YieldRails is the **first payment rail** that delivers:
- ✅ **4-10% APY** on stablecoin balances (via T-bills + delta-neutral DeFi)
- ✅ **<1-second settlements** globally (leveraging RLUSD on XRP Ledger)
- ✅ **0% transaction fees** (subsidized by yield generation)

### **Market Timing**
- **$247B** stablecoin supply growing 78% YoY
- **20% of Fortune 500** testing crypto payments
- **GENIUS Act** legitimizes yield-bearing stablecoins
- **RLUSD launch** provides institutional-grade liquidity
