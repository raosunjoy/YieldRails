## Task Completed: Task 27 - Implement yield strategy API endpoints

### Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive yield strategy API endpoints for the YieldRails platform. This includes yield strategy listing with real-time APY data, yield optimization endpoints with risk-adjusted allocation, yield history and performance tracking endpoints, yield withdrawal and distribution management, and strategy performance comparison and analytics.

### Key Accomplishments

1. **Enhanced YieldService with New Methods**
   - Implemented `getAvailableStrategies` for listing active yield strategies with real-time APY data
   - Added `getStrategyComparison` for comparing performance across different strategies
   - Created `getStrategyHistoricalPerformance` for retrieving historical performance data
   - Implemented `getUserPerformance` for detailed yield performance metrics
   - Added `getOverallAnalytics` for platform-wide yield analytics
   - Implemented `createStrategy` and `updateStrategy` for strategy management
   - Added `getYieldDistribution` for yield distribution details

2. **New API Endpoints**
   - Added `/api/yield/strategies/comparison` for strategy performance comparison
   - Implemented `/api/yield/strategies/:strategyId/performance` for historical performance
   - Created admin endpoints for strategy management (`POST /api/yield/strategies`, `PUT /api/yield/strategies/:strategyId`)
   - Added `/api/yield/payment/:paymentId/distribution` for yield distribution details

3. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Implemented risk-adjusted returns calculation
   - Added volatility and Sharpe ratio calculations
   - Created historical performance tracking
   - Implemented yield distribution analytics (70% user, 20% merchant, 10% protocol)

4. **Testing**
   - Created comprehensive unit tests for all YieldService methods
   - Added integration tests for all yield API endpoints
   - Ensured high test coverage for all critical paths

### Technical Details

1. **Architecture**

### Next Steps

1. **Task 28: Complete compliance API implementations**
   - Implement KYC document upload and verification endpoints
   - Add transaction monitoring and sanctions screening APIs
   - Create compliance status checking and reporting endpoints

2. **Task 29: Implement cross-chain bridge API endpoints**
   - Complete bridge transaction initiation with fee calculation
   - Add bridge status tracking and transaction monitoring
   - Implement bridge completion and settlement endpoints

### Conclusion
The implementation of yield strategy API endpoints is now complete and ready for use in the YieldRails platform. All endpoints have been thoroughly tested and integrated with the core services. The next steps are to complete the compliance API implementations and cross-chain bridge API endpoints.
