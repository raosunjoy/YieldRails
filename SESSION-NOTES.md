### üéØ Key Decisions Made

#### 1. Core Project Philosophy
- **100% Test Coverage**: Mandatory for all smart contracts, 95%+ for backend/frontend
- **100% Test Pass Rate**: No broken main branch policy
- **Test-First Development**: Write tests before implementation
- **Security-First**: Multi-audit approach with formal verification

#### 2. Architecture Decisions
- **Multi-Chain Strategy**: Ethereum (primary), XRPL (RLUSD), Solana, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base
- **Microservices Backend**: Payment, Yield, Cross-Chain, Compliance, Notification services
- **Database Strategy**: PostgreSQL (primary), TimescaleDB (analytics), Redis (cache)
- **Infrastructure**: AWS-based with ECS Fargate, auto-scaling, comprehensive monitoring

#### 3. Technology Stack Confirmed
```
Smart Contracts: Solidity 0.8.20, OpenZeppelin, Hardhat
Backend: Node.js, TypeScript, Express, PostgreSQL, Redis
Frontend: React, TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
Testing: Jest, Hardhat, Playwright, Codecov
Infrastructure: AWS, Docker, Terraform, GitHub Actions
```

#### 4. Yield Strategy Framework
- **T-Bills via Noble**: 4-5% safe yield
- **Delta-Neutral DeFi**: 8-10% optimized yield via Resolv
- **Multi-Strategy**: Automatic rebalancing and optimization
- **Yield Distribution**: 70% users, 20% merchants, 10% protocol

#### 5. Regulatory & Legal Structure
- **Primary Jurisdiction**: UAE (DMCC Free Zone) for 0% crypto tax
- **US Compliance**: GENIUS Act alignment for market access
- **Banking**: Mercury (primary), DBS Bank (backup)
- **Licenses**: VASP registration where required

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & Risks Identified

#### Technical Challenges:
1. **Multi-Chain Complexity**: Synchronizing state across 6+ blockchains
2. **Yield Optimization**: Balancing safety vs. returns in volatile markets
3. **Gas Costs**: Keeping transaction costs low while maintaining functionality
4. **Testing Complexity**: 100% coverage across multi-chain contracts

#### Business Risks:
1. **Regulatory Changes**: Yield classification under evolving stablecoin laws
2. **Competition**: Big tech entry (Stripe, PayPal) with deep pockets
3. **Market Conditions**: Bear market impact on DeFi yields
4. **Adoption Speed**: Merchant education and onboarding challenges

#### Mitigation Strategies:
- Multi-jurisdiction legal structure
- Conservative yield projections
- First-mover advantage execution
- Partnership-driven distribution
