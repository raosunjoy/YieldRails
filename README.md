# YieldRails

**The Yield-Powered Cross-Border Payment Rail**

YieldRails is a stablecoin-native payment infrastructure that combines the stability of major stablecoins (USDC, RLUSD, EURC) with built-in yield generation, enabling seamless cross-border transactions while generating passive income for users and merchants.

## Overview

YieldRails addresses the biggest gap in current payment systems: **lack of seamless, built-in yields for everyday holders and users in stablecoin ecosystems**. While traditional payment rails offer 0% yields and crypto volatility makes payments impractical, YieldRails provides:

- **Stable payments** via major stablecoins
- **Built-in yields** (4-10% APY) through T-bills and delta-neutral DeFi strategies
- **1-second settlements** via XRPL (RLUSD) and EVM chains
- **Zero fees** for basic transactions (subsidized by yield)

## Key Features

### 🏦 Multi-Stablecoin Support
- **USDC** (Primary) - Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base
- **RLUSD** (Cross-border) - XRP Ledger native
- **EURC** (European markets)

### 💰 Yield Generation
- **Noble/T-bills**: 4-5% APY on USDC holdings
- **Delta-neutral DeFi**: 8-10% APY via Resolv strategies
- **Yield sharing**: Users earn on idle balances, merchants get fee subsidies

### ⚡ Fast & Cheap
- **XRPL**: 1-second RLUSD settlements
- **EVM chains**: Gas abstraction via sponsored transactions
- **Cross-chain**: Circle CCTP for seamless USDC bridging

### 🌍 Global Coverage
- **Remittance corridors**: Philippines, Mexico, Brazil, Vietnam
- **Local partnerships**: MoneyGram, Ripple ODL
- **Fiat off-ramps**: MoonPay, Ramp integration

Yield Vaults ← Smart Contracts → Settlement Rails

T-bills/DeFi ←   Escrow Logic   → Bank/Cash-out
```

## Quick Start

### For Merchants
1. **Sign up** at [yieldrails.com](https://yieldrails.com)
2. **Install** Shopify/WooCommerce plugin
3. **Accept** USDC/RLUSD payments with automatic yield
4. **Settle** to fiat or keep earning yields

### For Developers
```bash
npm install @yieldrails/sdk

import { YieldRails } from '@yieldrails/sdk';

const yr = new YieldRails({ 
  chain: 'ethereum',
  apiKey: 'your-key'
});

// Accept payment with yield
await yr.createPayment({
  amount: 100,
  currency: 'USDC',
  merchant: 'merchant-id',
  yieldEnabled: true
});
```

## Market Opportunity

- **$247B** stablecoin market cap (2025)
- **$4.1T** monthly stablecoin volumes
- **63%** YoY growth in stablecoin usage
- **$120B+** potential annual yields (20% of card volume at 5% yield)
