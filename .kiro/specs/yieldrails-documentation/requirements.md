# YieldRails Platform Requirements Document

## Introduction

YieldRails is a comprehensive yield-powered cross-border payment infrastructure that combines stablecoin stability with DeFi yield generation. The platform enables seamless cross-border transactions while generating passive income for users and merchants through integrated yield strategies across multiple blockchain networks.

The system addresses the fundamental gap in current payment systems by providing stable payments via major stablecoins, built-in yields (4-10% APY) through T-bills and delta-neutral DeFi strategies, 1-second settlements via XRPL and EVM chains, and zero fees for basic transactions subsidized by yield.
