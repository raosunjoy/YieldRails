## 4. Response Procedures

### 4.1 Initial Response (DETECT)

#### Automated Detection
- Security monitoring alerts (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Log analysis alerts (ELK Stack)
- Intrusion detection system alerts
- Application security alerts

#### Manual Detection
- User reports of suspicious activity
- Security audit findings
- Third-party security notifications
- External threat intelligence

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Document the incident** in the incident tracking system
2. **Assess severity** using the classification matrix
3. **Notify the appropriate team members** based on severity
4. **Begin evidence collection** immediately
5. **Activate incident response procedures**

### 4.2 Investigation Phase (ANALYZE)

#### Evidence Collection
```bash
# Log collection commands
kubectl logs -n yieldrails-prod <pod-name> --since=24h > incident-logs.txt
docker logs yieldrails_backend_1 --since=24h > backend-incident.log
grep "security_event" /var/log/yieldrails/* > security-events.log
```

#### System Analysis
- Review authentication logs
- Analyze network traffic patterns
- Check database access logs
- Examine application error logs
- Review compliance audit trails

#### Threat Assessment
- Determine attack vectors
- Assess scope of compromise
- Identify affected systems and data
- Evaluate potential business impact

### 4.3 Containment Phase (CONTAIN)

#### Immediate Containment
```bash
# Block suspicious IP addresses
iptables -A INPUT -s <suspicious-ip> -j DROP

# Disable compromised user accounts
kubectl exec -it <auth-pod> -- node -e "
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');
const prisma = new PrismaClient();
prisma.user.update({
  where: { id: '<user-id>' },
  data: { status: 'SUSPENDED' }
});
"

# Isolate compromised services
kubectl scale deployment <compromised-service> --replicas=0
```

#### Network Isolation
- Implement network segmentation
- Block malicious traffic patterns
- Isolate affected systems
- Implement additional monitoring

#### Short-term Containment
- Apply security patches
- Update access controls
- Implement temporary workarounds
- Enhance monitoring for similar threats

### 4.4 Eradication Phase (ERADICATE)

#### System Hardening
```bash
# Update all systems
kubectl set image deployment/backend backend=yieldrails/backend:security-patch-v1.2.3

# Apply security configurations
kubectl apply -f security/network-policies.yaml
kubectl apply -f security/pod-security-policies.yaml
```

#### Malware Removal
- Run security scans on all systems
- Remove malicious files and processes
- Clean infected databases
- Verify system integrity

#### Vulnerability Remediation
- Apply security patches
- Update configurations
- Implement additional security controls
- Conduct security validation

### 4.5 Recovery Phase (RECOVER)

#### System Restoration
```bash
# Restore from clean backups if necessary
kubectl apply -f backups/clean-state-backup.yaml

# Restart services in secure configuration
kubectl rollout restart deployment/backend
kubectl rollout restart deployment/frontend

# Verify service health
kubectl get pods -n yieldrails-prod
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" https://api.yieldrails.com/health
```

#### Monitoring Enhancement
- Implement additional security controls
- Enhance logging and monitoring
- Conduct security validation testing
- Monitor for recurring threats

#### Business Operations
- Restore normal operations gradually
- Communicate with stakeholders
- Update incident documentation
- Conduct post-incident review
