- **Compliance Service**: KYC/AML verification and transaction compliance checks

### 2. Blockchain Interaction Helpers

- **ContractHelper Class**: Core functionality for interacting with smart contracts
- **Provider Management**: Chain-specific provider initialization and configuration
- **Contract Initialization**: Easy contract setup with ABI and address
- **Read/Write Operations**: Type-safe contract method calls
- **Transaction Management**: Gas estimation, transaction submission, and confirmation tracking
- **Explorer Integration**: Block explorer URL generation for transactions and addresses

### 3. WebSocket Client for Real-Time Updates

- **Event Subscription**: Type-safe event subscription system
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Robust reconnection logic with configurable parameters
- **Channel Management**: Payment, yield, and bridge event channels
- **Connection Lifecycle**: Connection establishment, monitoring, and graceful disconnection

### 4. Type Safety and Documentation

- **Comprehensive TypeScript Types**: Full type coverage for all API responses and requests
- **API Documentation**: Detailed API reference with examples
- **Code Examples**: Real-world usage examples for all major features
- **JSDoc Comments**: Thorough inline documentation

### 5. Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for all SDK components
- **Mock Implementations**: Test utilities for API and blockchain interactions
- **Error Handling Tests**: Validation of error handling patterns
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing of SDK functionality

### 6. Publishing and Versioning

- **Package Configuration**: NPM package setup with proper entry points
- **Versioning**: Semantic versioning with CHANGELOG
- **Bundle Optimization**: Size-optimized bundle with tree-shaking support
- **Distribution Files**: CommonJS and ES Module builds

## Implementation Details

### Blockchain Interaction Helpers

The `ContractHelper` class provides a comprehensive interface for blockchain interactions:

```typescript
// Initialize contract
const contract = sdk.initContract(
  'YieldEscrow',
  '0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4C9db96C4b4d8b9',
  YIELD_ESCROW_ABI,
  ChainName.ethereum
);

// Read from contract
const balance = await sdk.blockchain.readContract<bigint>(
  'USDC',
  'balanceOf',
  [userAddress]
);

// Write to contract
const tx = await sdk.blockchain.writeContract(
  'YieldEscrow',
  'createDeposit',
  [amount, tokenAddress, merchantAddress, strategyAddress, paymentHash, metadata]
);

// Wait for confirmation
const receipt = await sdk.waitForTransaction(ChainName.ethereum, tx.hash, 1);
```

### WebSocket Client Enhancements

The WebSocket client was enhanced with improved reconnection logic and type-safe event handling:

```typescript
// Initialize WebSocket
const wsClient = sdk.initializeWebSocket({
  reconnect: true,
  maxReconnectAttempts: 5,
});

// Type-safe event subscription
wsClient.on('payment:created', (data) => {
  console.log('New payment created:', data.paymentId);
});

// Channel subscription
wsClient.subscribeToPayment('payment-id');
```

### SDK Core Enhancements

The main SDK class was enhanced with blockchain integration and utility methods:

```typescript
// Connect wallet
const signer = await sdk.connectWallet(provider);

// Get transaction explorer URL
const txUrl = sdk.getTransactionExplorerUrl(ChainName.ethereum, tx.hash);

// Validate payment request
const validation = sdk.validatePaymentRequest({
  merchantAddress: '0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4C9db96C4b4d8b9',
  amount: '100.00',
  token: TokenSymbol.USDC,
  chain: ChainName.ethereum,
});
```

## Testing Strategy

The SDK implementation includes comprehensive testing:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing component interactions
3. **Mock Services**: Using Jest mocks for external dependencies
4. **Error Handling**: Validating error scenarios and recovery
5. **Edge Cases**: Testing boundary conditions and unusual inputs

## Documentation

Documentation was created at multiple levels:

1. **API Reference**: Comprehensive API documentation in `docs/API.md`
2. **README**: User-friendly getting started guide and examples
3. **JSDoc Comments**: Inline documentation for all public methods
4. **Code Examples**: Real-world usage examples in the `examples` directory
5. **CHANGELOG**: Version history and feature additions

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the SDK include:

1. **Browser Bundle**: Pre-built browser bundle with UMD format
2. **React Hooks**: React-specific hooks for common operations
3. **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for common operations
4. **Additional Blockchain Support**: Expanded support for non-EVM chains
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Enhanced analytics and reporting capabilities
6. **Offline Support**: Improved offline operation and queue management

## Conclusion

The YieldRails SDK now provides a comprehensive, type-safe, and well-documented interface for interacting with the YieldRails platform. The addition of blockchain interaction helpers, enhanced WebSocket support, and comprehensive API coverage makes it a powerful tool for developers building on the YieldRails ecosystem.
