## 🎯 Project Mission Statement
**YieldRails**: The first yield-powered stablecoin payment rail that enables users to earn 4-10% APY while making payments, with 1-second cross-border settlements and 0% transaction fees (subsidized by yield generation).

**Core Value Proposition**: "Money should earn while it moves"

---

## 🏗️ Project Core Principles (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 1. **Testing Philosophy**
- **100% test coverage** on all smart contracts (mandatory)
- **95%+ test coverage** on backend/frontend
- **100% test pass rate** (no broken main branch ever)
- **Test-first development** (write tests before implementation)

### 2. **Security Philosophy**
- **Security-first design** in all components
- **Multi-audit approach** for smart contracts
- **Formal verification** where applicable
- **Defense-in-depth** architecture

### 3. **Quality Philosophy**
- **No shortcuts** on testing or security
- **Documentation-driven development**
- **Code review requirements**
- **Automated quality gates**

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Technical Pitfalls
- **Skipping tests** to move faster (never acceptable)
- **Optimizing prematurely** before security audits
- **Single-chain thinking** (always design multi-chain)
- **Centralized architecture** (maintain decentralization)

### Business Pitfalls
- **Over-promising yields** (conservative projections only)
- **Ignoring regulations** (compliance-first approach)
- **Single jurisdiction** (maintain backup options)
- **Underestimating competition** (execute fast, iterate faster)
